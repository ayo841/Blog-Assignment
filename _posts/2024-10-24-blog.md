Noah's Ark: Symbolism in Christianity
	We are all familiar with the story of Noah and the great flood. For those unfamiliar with the story, the story of Noah represents an important moment in biblical history, as recorded in Genesis 6:5-22, where God decided to cleanse Earth due to the wickedness of humankind. Most times, we focus on the destruction, but I think is most important is what comes after God's wrath, the promise he made to us. Noah's Ark not only symbolizes the downfall or wrath of God, but more importantly, it represents the promise God made to never destroy the earth by flood again. The story of Noah not only symbolizes the weight of sin but also highlights God's divine mercy. This blog post will explore Noah's Ark as a material object with religious significance, highlighting how it symbolizes divine authority, power, and the rewards of unwavering obedience. 
	In the book of Genesis, we understand that God chose Noah because he found favor in God’s eyes. The chapter describes Noah as the only good man of his time, blameless and walking in fellowship with God. Noah’s unwavering faith, especially when evil and wickedness were prominent on Earth, is why God chose him to build the Ark. This shows that the Ark is not just a vessel of survival but a testament to Noah’s devotedness and obedience to God’s authority. Noah’s role as the person who built the Ark showcases his significant faith and trust in the Lord. The fact that God chose Noah, a simple man to complete such tasks shows that as long as one has faith in God, one can carry out his will.
       Although Noah’s Ark often symbolizes God’s wrath on Earth, it also holds deep significance on who it was made for. The Ark was created not only to save Noah but to save all of humanity, and animals from the flood. The Ark can be viewed as a material symbol of God’s mercy and preservation of humanity. It showcases God’s plan for the purification of the earth. The Ark’s size is also significant in understanding God’s plan for the salvation of the Earth. God instructed Noah to build the Ark “three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.” Its huge size is evidence that God wanted to save not only Noah and his family but humanity as a whole as well as two of each living creature. 
Also, the material used by Noah in building the Ark is important. Noah was instructed to use wood in the construction of the Ark, making it pitch inside and out. This specific instruction to Noah is significant as making the Ark pitch makes it impossible for it to be destroyed by the great flood. It symbolizes God's protection and his covenant to Noah ensuring his family and animals are kept safe. It also shows the importance of obeying God’s word regardless of how difficult it may seem. 
Lastly, the Ark, as a material object is evidence of divine power. It emphasizes the idea that God has ultimate control over all things on Earth. It is also significant by showing the importance of one’s obedience to God, emphasizing the idea that those who obey God would be saved from destruction.
